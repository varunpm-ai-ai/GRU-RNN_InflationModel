# ðŸ‡®ðŸ‡³ India & Bengaluru Inflation Forecasting Models (GRU-RNN Model)
Predicting inflation rates of indian economy and benglore economy using an upgraded method of RNN, GRU-RNN method to get the best results 

## Project Overview

This project utilizes a GRU-RNN (Gated Recurrent Unit - Recurrent Neural Network) to predict inflation rates for both the Indian economy and the Bangalore region. The model leverages multiple economic indicators to achieve high accuracy in forecasting.

Model                     Focus           Key Feature

Model 1: India National  National-level  Multi-year, iterative forecasting using user-defined
CPI Forecast             inflation.      baseline inputs.

Model 2: Bengaluru       Local/Regional  Demonstrates adaptability of the GRU architecture for
CPI Forecast             inflation.      specific regional data.
