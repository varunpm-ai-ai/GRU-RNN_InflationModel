## Project Overview

This project utilizes a GRU-RNN (Gated Recurrent Unit - Recurrent Neural Network) to predict inflation rates for both the Indian economy and the Bangalore region. The model leverages multiple economic indicators to achieve high accuracy in forecasting.

bash
```
Model                     Focus           Key Feature

Model 1: India National  National-level  Multi-year, iterative forecasting using user-defined
CPI Forecast             inflation.      baseline inputs.

Model 2: Bengaluru       Local/Regional  Demonstrates adaptability of the GRU architecture for
CPI Forecast             inflation.      specific regional data.
```

##  Key Economic Indicators Used

- **CPI (Consumer Price Index)**
- **GDP Growth**
- **Unemployment Rate**
- **Crude Oil Prices**
- **Gold Prices**
- **Real Estate Index**
- **Stock Index**
- **Money Supply M1**
- **Money Supply M2**
- **Industrial Production**
- **Retail Sales**
- **Exchange Rate**

These factors are consistently used for both the Indian and Bangalore inflation predictions.

## Model Architecture & Methodology
The core methodology for both the national and regional models is a standard practice for time series forecasting, allowing the model to learn relationships between historical economic data and future inflation.

# 1. Data Preparation (Crucial Steps)

Time Step Aggregation: Input data is processed using annual averages to focus on macro-economic shifts rather than monthly volatility.

Lagged Features: The model employs a time window of $N=4$ preceding years ($T-4$ to $T-1$) to predict the CPI in the target year $T$. This captures the historical inertia of inflation and economic policy impacts.

Feature Scaling: All 12 input features (including lagged CPI) are crucial for the GRU model. They are standardized using StandardScaler ($\mu=0, \sigma=1$) to prevent features with larger numerical scales (like Stock_Index) from dominating the learning process.

# 2. GRU Network Structure

Both Model 1 and Model 2 share this identical architecture, demonstrating model transferability across datasets:
bash
```
Layer   Type      Configuration                  Purpose

L1      GRU       16 units, tanh activation,     Extracts sequential dependencies and prepares
                  return_sequences=True          output for next GRU layer
 
L2      Dropout   20%                            Reduces complex co-adaptations between neurons
                                                 (overfitting)

L3      GRU       8 units, tanh activation,      Consolidates the 4-year sequence data into a final,
                  return_sequences=False         comprehensive vector for prediction.

L4      Dropout   20%                            Prevents overfitting.


L5      Dense     16 units, ReLU activation, L2  Performs non-linear transformation and feature
                  Regularization                 weighting prior to output.

output  Dense     1 unit (Linear activation)     Outputs the single predicted CPI value (scaled).

```

# 3. Forecasting Logic

The Streamlit app utilizes Iterative Multi-Step Prediction:

Prediction (Year $T$): The model takes the last 4 known years ($T-4$ to $T-1$) and predicts CPI for year $T$.

Iteration (Year $T+1$): To forecast the subsequent year ($T+1$), the oldest data point ($T-4$) is dropped. The new sequence is formed by $T-3, T-2, T-1,$ and the predicted CPI from year $T$. The other economic indicators are held constant at the user-provided baseline.

Output: This process repeats until the selected target year is reached, generating a robust, long-term forecast series.
